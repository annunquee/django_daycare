## DAY CARE CENTER

* Having the possibility to erase data of an outgoing student, while creating new data for the incoming ones,
will make my job alot smoother, as a staff.

* Adding parents profile to their child/ward data will make contacting them in times of an emergency alot easier.

* As staffs it will make our job go alot smoother if we can have an inbox for the user experience were their
messages are stored for queries and inquiry purposes.

* As tutors having a place were we can store the pupils projects for viewing, so parents can be updated on their ward's latest school projects and can browse in easily, will come in really handy.

* As a new parent enrolling their ward i would love to be able to register in my details and that of my child only once so i can easily longin and out without having to update my info everytime i'm loggedin.

* As parents forgetting passwords are common with us i will like a user experience that allows me change or retrive a lost password easily by just updating my email addressing.

* As a staff i would like the student to have a registration number, this will make differntiating students with
similar data alot easier.

## DAY CARE CENTER

* Having the possibility to erase data of an outgoing student, while creating new data for the incoming ones,
will make my job alot smoother, as a staff.

* Adding parents profile to their child/ward data will make contacting them in times of an emergency alot easier.

* As a staff i would like the student to have a registration number, this will make differntiating students with
similar data alot easier.

* while being looked after i would like an affordable day care center, which provides it's students with montessori educational
system, so my ward can have fun while learning.

* As a parent i will like a child care center, where i dont need to worry about rushing back due to the pickup time
while still very busy at work.
